## Workflows

### Duden Workflow

![](assets/icons/duden.png)

Search, navigate and view information from duden.de German spelling dictionary. 

- ` shift ‚áß ` or `cmd ‚åò+Y`: Get QuickLook previews for the landing page, grammar, and synonyms
- `cmd ‚åò+L` to view the full entry contents.
- Action synonymes to list all synonyms. Action any synonym to view the entry for it.
- Action examples or idioms to list all that are available.

The *What Unicode Character is this?* workflow tells you which unicode character it is. Given a character or string, you will get the unicode code points, the scalar names and general categories.

<table> 
    <tr border-spacing=0>
        <td>
            <img src="assets/icons/whatisit.png"> 
        </td>
        <td>
            The <i>What Unicode Character is this?</i> workflow tells you which unicode character it is. Given a character or string, you will get the unicode code points, the scalar names and general categories.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Example `„ÉÑ`

- KATAKANA LETTER TU
- `U+30C4`
- Other Letter

#### Modifiers

- `‚åò cmd` yields `\u{30C4}` (swift, ES6 formatted)
- `‚å• opt` yields `\u30C4` (python, go formatted)
- `‚åÉ ctrl` yields `&#x30C4;` (HTML entity)
- `‚áß shift` yields `0x30C4` (hex literal)

#### Inverse

Given a hex value either raw or in any of the above formattings will return its corresponding unicode character.
- `whatisit? \u{1F914}` yields info for ü§î

### DEVONthink ‚Üî PDF Expert


![](assets/icons/dt3pdf.png)

Get the DEVONthink 3 reference URL from PDF Expert, i.e. the `x-devonthink-item` page link for the active document opened in PDF Expert.

**Expected result:** `x-devonthink-item://1D7FA99A-AAFF-4883-9853-F0666A650400?page=6`


#### Known issues

- Fails for document pages that are indexed with roman numerals
- Fails for documents where the backmatter page description does not conform to the enumeration scheme
- Fails for the left-hand side document if the PDF Expert split view is enabled



## Proof of Concept & Demos

### Modifier Palettes & Double Tap Hotkeys

Proof of Concept and demo implementation of modifier palettes to invoke actions on key combinations in Alfred. 

Modifier Palette example behavior  
: `‚å•+O ‚å•+K` To trigger action A.  
: `‚å•+I ‚å•+K` To trigger action B.

Double Tap example behavior  
: `‚å•+# ‚å•+#` To trigger action.
